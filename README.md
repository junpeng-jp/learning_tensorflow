# Learning Tensorflow

A deep learning playground for experimentation with Tensorflow libraries and APIs. The main objective is to obtain a broad understanding of Tensorflow features as foudnation formore advance applications of Tensorflow. Check the official [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions) and [Tensorflow guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn) for more information.

## Libraries
